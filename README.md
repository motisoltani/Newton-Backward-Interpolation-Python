# Newton-Backward-Interpolation-Python
Interpolation is the technique of estimating the value of a function for any intermediate value of the independent variable, while the process of computing the value of the function outside the given range is called extrapolation. that takes on certain values at arbitrary points. This program implements Newton Backward Interpolation Method in python programming language. By entering the point at which you want to calculate, you can find the value of polynomial.
